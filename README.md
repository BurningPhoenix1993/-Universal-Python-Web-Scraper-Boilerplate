Universal Python Web Scraper Boilerplate
This tool serves as a starting framework for anyone needing to scrape websitesâ€”whether for data science, research, or automationâ€”and can be adopted by both beginners and advanced coders.

ðŸ“„ What Is It?
A plug-and-play Python script (or mini-package) that can:
Take any website URL and a CSS selector or XPath as input.
Fetch and parse web page content.
Output clean, structured data (CSV, Excel, JSON).

Out of the box, it works with most static sites and can be extended for dynamic ones (with Selenium/Playwright).
ðŸ’¡ Features
Quick Start: Minimal configurationâ€”just pass a URL, selector, and output format.
Clean Output: Exports to CSV, Excel, and JSON.
Extensible: Well-documented code for easy customization (add login, pagination, dynamic JavaScript, etc.).
Error Handling: Robust against missing selectors and failed requests.
Beginner Friendly: Simple CLI interface and code comments.
Bonus: Utility functions for user-agent rotation and anti-blocking basics.
